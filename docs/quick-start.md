    ### Step 2: Connect to DBSnapper Cloud

    ```bash
    dbsnapper config init
    dbsnapper auth token YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
    ```

    ### Step 3: Configure Team Storage

    Add your team's storage profile in the cloud dashboard or config:

    ```yaml
    storage_profiles:
      team_storage:
        provider: s3
        bucket: your-team-snapshots
        awscli_profile: production
    ```

    ### Step 4: Create Team Targets

    Configure targets with sanitization and sharing:

    ```yaml
    targets:
      production_app:
        snapshot:
          src_url: "postgresql://user:pass@prod:5432/app"
          dst_url: "postgresql://user:pass@dev:5432/app_dev"
        storage_profile: team_storage
        sanitize:
          query_file: "sanitize.sql"
        # Enable team sharing via SSO groups
        sso_groups: ["developers", "qa-team"]
    ```

    ### Step 5: Build and Share Snapshots

    ```bash
    # Build original and sanitized snapshots
    dbsnapper sanitize production_app -n
    
    # Team members can now access via shared targets
    dbsnapper targets --shared
    ```

    üéâ **Success!** Your team can now access sanitized snapshots securely.

=== "üîß Integrate with Your Workflow"

    **Perfect for:** Developers who want DBSnapper integrated into their daily workflow.

    **What you'll accomplish:**

        dbsnapper = {
          source = "dbsnapper/dbsnapper"
        }
      }
    }
    
    resource "dbsnapper_target" "production" {
      name = "production-api"
      snapshot = {
        src_url = var.database_url
        dst_url = var.dev_database_url
      }
      storage_profile = "team-s3"
    }
    ```

    ### Step 4: Enable MCP Server (Optional)
