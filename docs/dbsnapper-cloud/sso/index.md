# Single Sign-On: Enterprise Team Authentication

Transform your database snapshot workflow from individual access to **secure, organization-wide collaboration**. DBSnapper's SSO integration connects with your existing identity infrastructure to provide automatic team provisioning, group-based access control, and enterprise-grade security for database snapshots.

## The Enterprise Access Challenge

As your development team grows, managing database snapshot access becomes complex:

### **üîê Individual Account Chaos**
- Manual user provisioning for each team member
- No centralized control over who accesses what data
- Difficult to onboard/offboard team members
- Password management and security becomes a burden

### **üö´ Security & Compliance Gaps**  
- No audit trail of who accessed sensitive database snapshots
- Different access levels across team members are hard to manage
- Compliance teams can't easily review data access patterns
- Potential data exposure when team members leave

### **‚ö° Operational Bottlenecks**
- IT teams become bottlenecks for database access requests
- Developers wait for manual provisioning before they can work
- No automated way to share snapshots based on project teams
- Mixed access patterns create security vulnerabilities

## DBSnapper SSO: Your Identity Infrastructure, Extended

DBSnapper's SSO integration seamlessly extends your existing identity management to cover database snapshot access‚Äîno additional user management required.

### **üéØ Automatic Team Provisioning**

**Leverage Your Existing Identity Provider:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Your Identity Provider<br/>Okta, Auth0, Azure AD] --> B[SSO Groups<br/>developers, qa-team, data-analysts]
    B --> C[DBSnapper Cloud<br/>Automatic Access]
    C --> D[Sanitized Snapshots<br/>Based on Group Membership]
    
    E[New Team Member] --> A
    A --> |Automatic| C
    C --> |Instant Access| D
```

**What This Means:**
- **New hires** get database access automatically based on their team assignment
- **Departing employees** lose access immediately when deactivated in your identity system
- **Project teams** are provisioned database access based on SSO group membership
- **Zero manual provisioning** by IT teams for database snapshot access

### **üõ°Ô∏è Group-Based Snapshot Sharing**

**Secure, intelligent access control using your organizational structure:**

```yaml
# Target configuration with SSO group sharing
targets:
  production_users_api:
    snapshot:
      src_url: "postgresql://readonly@prod-cluster:5432/users_api"
    storage_profile: production_s3
    sanitize:
      storage_profile: team_sanitized_s3
      override_query: |
        -- GDPR-compliant sanitization
        UPDATE users SET 
          email = CONCAT('user', id, '@example.com'),
          ssn = NULL, phone = '555-0000';
    # Only these SSO groups can access sanitized snapshots
    sso_groups: ["backend-developers", "qa-engineers"]

  financial_reports:  
    # More sensitive data - restricted access
    sso_groups: ["senior-developers", "finance-team", "compliance-auditors"]
    
  reference_data:
    # Broadly shared reference data
    sso_groups: ["all-engineering", "product-managers", "customer-support"]
```

**Access Control Benefits:**
- **Automatic sharing** - Sanitized snapshots shared with authorized groups instantly
- **Granular permissions** - Different data sensitivity levels for different teams
- **Organizational alignment** - Access control follows your company structure
- **Audit compliance** - Complete trail of group-based access decisions

## Real-World SSO Workflows

### **üë®‚Äçüíº IT Administrator: SSO Setup**

```yaml
# 1. Configure SSO in DBSnapper Cloud
sso:
  okta:
    provider_url: https://yourcompany.okta.com
    client_id: dbsnapper-production-client
    # Groups automatically synced from your identity provider

# 2. Define group-based target access
targets:
  prod_api_database:
    sso_groups: ["backend-developers", "senior-engineers"]
    sanitize:
      sso_groups: ["backend-developers", "qa-engineers", "data-analysts"]
      
  staging_api_database:
    sso_groups: ["all-developers", "qa-engineers"]
```

### **üë©‚Äçüíª New Developer: Automatic Access**

```bash
# Day 1: New developer joins the team

# 1. IT adds them to "backend-developers" group in Okta
# 2. They sign into DBSnapper Cloud using SSO
# 3. Automatically get access to authorized targets

dbsnapper targets
# Shows: prod_api_database, staging_api_database (based on group membership)

dbsnapper load prod_api_database
# Loads latest sanitized snapshot - no manual provisioning required
```

### **üë®‚Äçüíº Security Team: Compliance Audit**

```bash

## Getting Started with SSO

### **‚ö° Quick Setup Process**

1. **[Configure Okta Integration](sso-okta-oidc.md)** - Complete step-by-step setup guide
2. **Define SSO Groups** - Map your organizational structure to database access
3. **Configure Target Sharing** - Set up group-based access for your database targets

### **üéØ Implementation Strategy**

=== "**Start Small**"
    
    Begin with a single team and one database target:
    ```yaml
    targets:
      staging_api:
        sso_groups: ["backend-team-pilot"]
        # Test with staging data first
    ```

=== "**Scale Gradually**" 

    Add more teams and production targets:
    ```yaml
    targets:
      production_api:
        sso_groups: ["backend-developers"]  # Expanded access
        
      analytics_warehouse:  
        sso_groups: ["data-team", "analysts"]  # New team type
    ```

=== "**Full Deployment**"

    Complete organizational rollout:
    ```yaml
    # Multi-environment, multi-team access control
    targets:
      prod_users_api:
        sso_groups: ["senior-developers", "devops-team"]
      prod_orders_api:  
        sso_groups: ["backend-developers", "qa-engineers"]
