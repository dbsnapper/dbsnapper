‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dbsnapper-qa-engineers      # Testing and QA database access
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dbsnapper-data-analysts     # Analytics and reporting access
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dbsnapper-admins           # Full administrative access
```

3. **Add users to appropriate groups** based on their roles and access needs

### **3.2 Configure Target Access in DBSnapper**

**Map your Okta groups to database targets:**

```yaml
# Example target configuration with group-based access
targets:
  production_api:
    snapshot:
      src_url: "postgresql://readonly@prod-cluster:5432/api"
    storage_profile: prod_s3
    sanitize:
      storage_profile: sanitized_s3  
      override_query: |
        UPDATE users SET 
          email = CONCAT('user', id, '@example.com'),
          ssn = NULL;
    # Only these Okta groups can access sanitized snapshots  
    sso_groups: ["dbsnapper-developers", "dbsnapper-qa-engineers"]

  sensitive_financial:
    # More restrictive access for sensitive data
    sso_groups: ["dbsnapper-senior-engineers", "dbsnapper-data-analysts"]
    
  reference_data:  
    # Broadly accessible reference data
    sso_groups: ["dbsnapper-developers", "dbsnapper-qa-engineers", "dbsnapper-data-analysts"]
```

## Step 4: Test & Validate Integration

### **4.1 Test Authentication Flow**

**Verify the complete authentication process:**

1. **Visit DBSnapper Cloud sign-in page**: [app.dbsnapper.com/sign_in](https://app.dbsnapper.com/sign_in)
2. **Enter your corporate email address** (must match Organization Domain)
3. **Click "Next"** 
4. **Click "Sign in with SSO"** button
5. **You should be redirected to Okta** for authentication
6. **Complete Okta authentication** (including MFA if required)

**Test that group membership controls access correctly:**

=== "**üë®‚Äçüíª Developer Test**"

    ```bash
    # User in "dbsnapper-developers" group should see:
    dbsnapper targets
    # Output should show targets with sso_groups: ["dbsnapper-developers"]
    
    dbsnapper load production_api
    # Should successfully load sanitized snapshot
    ```

=== "**üë®‚Äçüíº Admin Test**"

    ```bash
    # User in "dbsnapper-admins" group should see:
    dbsnapper targets  
    # Output should show all targets they have access to
    
    # Should be able to create new targets via DBSnapper Cloud interface
    ```

=== "**üö´ Access Restriction Test**"

    ```bash
    # User NOT in required SSO groups should:
    dbsnapper targets
    # NOT see restricted targets
    
    dbsnapper load sensitive_financial
    # Should receive "Access Denied" error
    ```

### **4.3 Monitor Integration Health**
