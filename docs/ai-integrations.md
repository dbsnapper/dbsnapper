# AI Integrations

!!! success "New in v3.0.0-pr1 Preview"
    DBSnapper v3.0.0-pr1 introduces AI integration capabilities through Model Context Protocol (MCP) support. This preview release demonstrates the core AI functionality with comprehensive MCP server integration for AI assistants.

## Overview

DBSnapper's AI integration capabilities enable developers and teams to interact with their database snapshots, targets, and configurations through natural language conversations with AI assistants. Instead of memorizing command-line syntax, you can simply tell your AI assistant what you want to accomplish.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Natural Language Interface**: Interact with DBSnapper using plain English
- **Intelligent Discovery**: AI assistants can help discover and configure database tools automatically
- **Context-Aware Operations**: AI can understand your workflow and suggest appropriate actions
- **Enhanced Productivity**: Faster snapshot operations through conversational interfaces
- **Error Prevention**: AI validation helps catch configuration issues before they cause problems

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

The Model Context Protocol provides a standardized way for AI applications to access external tools and data sources. DBSnapper's MCP server exposes comprehensive functionality through this protocol.

### Supported AI Applications

- **Claude Desktop** - Anthropic's desktop AI application
- **Claude Code** - Anthropic's VS Code-integrated AI assistant  
- **Any MCP-compatible AI client** - The standard protocol ensures broad compatibility

### Core Capabilities

#### üéØ **Target Management**
- List and explore all configured database targets
- Get detailed information about specific targets including snapshots
- Safely update target configurations with validation
- Access sanitized configuration data

#### üì∏ **Snapshot Operations** 
- Create new database snapshots with natural language commands
- Load snapshots into target databases
- Browse available snapshots with rich metadata
- Access snapshot creation history and statistics

#### üîí **Sanitization & Security**
- Create sanitized snapshots with sensitive data removed
- Validate configurations including sanitization queries
- Access sanitization templates for common use cases
- Real-time validation with detailed error reporting

#### üõ†Ô∏è **Database Tools Management**
- Automatically discover database client tools (pg_dump, mysql, etc.)
- Validate database tools configuration
- Resolve PATH and configuration issues automatically

### Quick Start

1. **Install DBSnapper v3.0+** with MCP support
2. **Configure your AI application** to use the DBSnapper MCP server  
3. **Start conversing** with your AI assistant about database operations

#### Configuration Example

For Claude Desktop/Code, add to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dbsnapper": {
      "command": "dbsnapper",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "description": "DBSnapper database snapshot management"
    }
  }
}
```

### Example Conversations

#### Getting Started
```
You: "What database targets do I have configured?"

AI: I'll check your configured database targets.

You have 3 targets configured:
- production-db (PostgreSQL, cloud target)
- staging-db (PostgreSQL, local target)  
- analytics-db (MySQL, local target)
```

#### Creating and Managing Snapshots
```
You: "Create a sanitized snapshot of my production database for development"

AI: I'll create a sanitized snapshot of your production database that's safe for development use.

‚úÖ Sanitized snapshot created successfully!
- Sanitized snapshot: 1705123456_production-db.san.zip
- Original size: 2.1 GB, Sanitized size: 1.8 GB  
- PII data removed, email addresses anonymized
- Ready for development team use
```

#### Configuration Validation
```
You: "Check if all my database configurations are valid"

AI: I'll validate your complete DBSnapper configuration.

‚úÖ Configuration validation completed!

Configuration Validation: PASSED
  Target: production-db: PASS
  Target: staging-db: PASS
  Target: analytics-db: PASS
  Global Configuration: PASS

All targets and configurations are valid and ready for use.
```

#### Tool Discovery
```
You: "My snapshots are failing - can you help fix the database tools?"

AI: I'll discover and configure your database tools automatically.

‚úÖ Database tools discovered and configured!
- PostgreSQL tools: /opt/homebrew/bin/pg_dump, pg_restore, psql
- MySQL tools: /opt/homebrew/bin/mysql, mysqldump
- Configuration saved permanently
- All tools validated and ready for use
```
